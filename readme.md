# Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) - Core Concepts

This section of the repository documents my foundational journey into the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. It focuses on the core pillars of cloud computing: governance, architecture, and service models.

---

## 🏗️ Knowledge Domains
This portfolio demonstrates a deep understanding of:

* **Cloud Concepts:** Distinguishing between **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS** service models and choosing the right deployment for the business.
* **Core Architecture:** Understanding Regions, Availability Zones, and Resource Groups to build highly available solutions.
* **Azure Services:** Foundational knowledge of Compute (VMs, App Services), Storage, and Networking (Vnets, NSGs).
* **Governance & Compliance:** Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Azure Policy, and Resource Locks to maintain security.
* **Pricing & Cost Management:** Using the TCO Calculator and Azure Advisor to optimize cloud spend and manage SLAs.

## 🎯 Learning Goal
My primary objective for this section was to build a rock-solid theoretical and practical foundation before progressing to the **AZ-104 (Administrator)**

> **Key Takeaway:** Cloud is not just about "where" you host data, but "how" you manage, secure, and scale it efficiently.
