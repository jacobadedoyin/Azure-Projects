## Deployment Evidence & Technical Analysis

### 1. High Availability & Regional Resiliency

**Analysis:**
* **Region (UK South):** Deployed to the London region to ensure data residency compliance and low latency for UK-based users.
* **Redundancy (ZRS):** Configured **Zone-Redundant Storage**. Unlike LRS (Local), ZRS synchronously replicates data across three distinct Azure availability zones. This ensures the application remains available even if an entire data center facility experiences a power or cooling failure.

### 2. Zero-Trust Security Configuration

**Analysis:**
* **Public Access (Disabled):** This is a "Zero-Trust" implementation. By disabling public access, the storage account is shielded from the public internet, mitigating risks of brute-force attacks or accidental data exposure.
* **Network Isolation:** The audit confirms that traffic is restricted. In the next phase of this project, access will only be granted via **Private Endpoints**, ensuring data stays within the Azure backbone network.
* **Infrastructure as Code (Verification):** The CLI output matches the Bicep template exactly, proving a successful transition from "Code" to "Cloud."
