## 🛠️ Technical Skills Matrix

### 🔐 Identity & Governance
* **Hybrid Identity:** Managing users and groups via Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
* **Policy Enforcement:** Authoring JSON-based Azure Policies to enforce compliance (e.g., SKU restrictions).
* **Access Control:** Implementing Granular RBAC and Custom Roles for "Least Privilege" access.

### 🌐 Networking & Security
* **Traffic Management:** Designing segmentation using NSGs, ASGs, and Firewall rules.
* **Connectivity:** Implementing VNet Peering and VPN Gateway logic for hybrid connectivity.
* **Load Balancing:** Configuring Layer-4 (Load Balancer) and Layer-7 (App Gateway) traffic distribution.

### ⚙️ Compute, Storage & Containers
* **Autoscaling:** Configuring Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) to handle traffic spikes dynamically.
* **Containerization:** Deploying **Azure Container Instances (ACI)** with persistent volume mounts (Azure Files).
* **Disaster Recovery (DR):** Implementing **Azure Backup** policies and Recovery Services Vaults for business continuity.
* **Observability:** Configuring **Azure Monitor** alerts to detect and respond to CPU spikes and health probes.
