## 📌 Executive Summary
This repository validates my practical mastery of the **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)** curriculum. Moving beyond theory, I have architected and deployed functional cloud environments to demonstrate the core principles of **Scalability**, **High Availability**, and **Cloud Governance**.

These projects serve as a proof-of-concept for the **Azure Well-Architected Framework**, translating abstract concepts into secure, running infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Matrix

### ☁️ Cloud Concepts & Architecture
* **Service Models:** Practical implementation of **IaaS** (VMs) for control vs. **PaaS** (Web Apps) for productivity.
* **Global Infrastructure:** Leveraging **Regions** and **Availability Zones** to design resilient applications.
* **Scalability:** Understanding the difference between Vertical Scaling (Scale Up) and Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out).

### 🔐 Security & Identity
* **Network Hardening:** Implementing "Zero Trust" basics using **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to whitelist only necessary traffic (SSH/HTTP).
* **Identity Management:** Managing access via **Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD) and verifying **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
* **Compliance:** Using **Resource Locks** (`CanNotDelete`) to enforce operational security on critical assets.

### 💰 Cloud Economics (FinOps)
* **Cost Accountability:** Implementing a strategic **Tagging Taxonomy** (e.g., `CostCenter: IT`) to allocate spend accurately.
* **OpEx vs. CapEx:** Optimizing costs by selecting the appropriate consumption-based model (Serverless) over fixed provisioning.
